# Counterfactual/Contrastive Analysis for Unsupervised Image Editing in Stable Diffusion

This project extends the idea of [TIME (Counterfactual Analysis)](https://github.com/guillaumejs2403/TIME) by proposing an improved **Contrastive Analysis (CA) framework**.
Our approach explicitly disentangles **context**, **common**, and **salient** factors between two domains, enabling more interpretable **attribute disentanglement and editing** in Stable Diffusion

## üìå Background & Motivation
Counterfactual (CF) approaches often learn embeddings that **mix both shared and domain-specific information**, making it difficult to interpret which factors truly drive the generation.

In contrast, our framework introduces three types of embeddings:
- **Context** ‚Äì dataset-level biases (lighting, scene composition)
- **Common** ‚Äì class-agnostic features shared across domains (e.g., facial structure)
- **Salient** ‚Äì domain-specific cues that distinguish one class from another (e.g., eyeglasses)

By separating these components, the learned embeddings gain clearer semantics, making attribute editing more interpretable and controllable ‚Äî and crucially, the method **does not require a classifier at inference time**.

We further conducted ablation studies on three training strategies for pseudo-word embeddings and found that the third strategy consistently outperforms the original TIME framework.

Additionally, in our unsupervised setup, we train pseudo-word embeddings using **`"unknown"`** as the prompt token across datasets, and achieve results qualitatively consistent with the original TIME approach.
